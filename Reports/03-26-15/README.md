### Work Done
- Compared various statistical methods. (a12, bootstrap, cliffs-delta, ANOVA+BLOM, Linear cliffs delta)
  - Looks like statistical method does not matter much.
- Compared error estimation techniques like MRE
  - This changes the ranking and this is actually justified in Reliability and validity in comparitative software studies
  

### Results
- MRE 
  - [Tile Charts](https://github.com/ai-se/statatak/blob/master/Reports/03-26-15/full_stats.md)
