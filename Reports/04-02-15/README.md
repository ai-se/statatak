### Work Done
- Count of ranks of all hypotheses
  - [Tile Charts](https://github.com/ai-se/statatak/blob/master/Reports/04-02-15/full_stats_99.md)
  - [Rank Tables](https://github.com/ai-se/statatak/blob/master/Reports/04-02-15/MRE_Table.csv) 
- Effect of other hypotheses on PEEKING
  - [Tile Charts](https://github.com/ai-se/statatak/blob/master/Reports/04-02-15/Cripplers.md)
  - [Rank Tables](https://github.com/ai-se/statatak/blob/master/Reports/04-02-15/Crippled.csv) 
- Variants of peeking to justify smote and teak
  - [Tile Charts](https://github.com/ai-se/statatak/blob/master/Reports/04-02-15/Prune_And_Crude.md)
  - [Rank Tables](https://github.com/ai-se/statatak/blob/master/Reports/04-02-15/Prune_AND_CRUDE.csv) 

### Doubts
 - How can we justify FP vs LOC?
 - Should we include model based methods? But model based beats analogy based?
